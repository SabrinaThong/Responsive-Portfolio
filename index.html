        <p>Hello all! My name is Sabrina Thong and I am currently taking a coding bootcamp course at the University of Minnesota. I graduated from Jordan High School in Jordan, Minnesota and decided to go
        to Normandale Community College to get my associate degree in general studies. After receiving my associates degree, I still had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Hennepin Technical 
        college to study web design/graphic design. During that time I got to learn about web development and it caught my interest, so I looked into other classes that would teach me more about developing websites. Sadly, there
        was a limited number of those types of classes. I found an available HTML & CSS class, so I signed up for it and really liked it. Then one day while I was scrolling through my Facebook page I 
        see an advertisement about a coding boot camp at the University of Minnesota, so I clicked it and immediatley applied.
      </p>
      <p> Other than coding, I like to golf, go camping, swimming, playing basketball and soccer, and traveling.
