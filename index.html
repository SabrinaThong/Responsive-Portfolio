        <p>Hello, my name is Sabrina Thong and this is my portfolio website. I graduated from Jordan High School in 2016
            and decided to go to Normandale Community College to get my associate degree. At Normandale, I discovered my
            passion for Web Development. After graduating I decided to go to Hennepin Technical College to get a 
            technical degree in web design, where I took a few web development classes that really interested me. 
            I really enjoyed the classes I took for my first semester at Hennepin Tech, but I wanted something more,
            I didn't know what more I wanted unti I found the coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota link. I have 
            since graduated from there with a full-stack web developent certification. Beside coding, I love to spend time
            with family, golf, swim, play soccer, and read.
